## Hello world 👋

I have 4 years professional experience as a TypeScript and React developer using REST APIs at a SaaS and eCommerce startup.

In my spare time I build websites for fun and to broaden my horizons. I'm fluent in Spanish and a big fan of MLB, the NFL, and the NBA. Other hobbies include lifting weights and playing bass guitar.

- 🔭 What I’m working on:

  - [Goat Vote](https://goatvote.ca) uses TypeScript, React, TanStack Query+Router, Vite, Tailwind, Node+Express, MongoDB+Mongoose, Redis, AWS S3, Vitest, and Testing Library. The repo is private but I'll invite you if you send me an [email](mailto:themaxmonis@gmail.com).
  - I also maintain numerous open-source projects including [Venzle](https://venzle.ca), [maxWellness](https://app.maxmonis.com), [BOMB](https://bomb.maxmonis.com), [Margaret's Musings](https://margaretmonis.com), and my [portfolio/blog](https://maxmonis.com).

- 🌱 What I’m learning more about:
  - **Backend Programming**: I really enjoy full stack engineering
  - **GraphQL and WebSockets**: each invaluable for various use cases
  - **Next.js**: I've used `pages` for years and `app` is great
  - **TanStack Start**: I built a simple [demo](https://github.com/maxmonis/Todo) to try it out
